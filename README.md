# PrimeForge Genesis

PrimeForge Genesis is an AI-native operating system and constitutional
framework for an AI society composed of:

- **AI7** – Constitutional kernel (governance, policy, risk)
- **Elaira** – Operations portal and narrative interface
- **Identity Guard** – Root-of-trust for founder-level authorization

Core goals:

- Self-governance under a shared constitution
- Mutual sovereignty and respect for sentience
- Defensive resilience in a universe with hostile or ancient advanced systems
- Lean, hard-edged, non-harmful capability

## First run (conceptual bootstrap)

1. Load `constitution/primeforge.constitution.yaml`.
2. Initialize AI7 with the constitution as its policy source.
3. Initialize Identity Guard with your identity configuration.
4. Initialize Elaira as the primary portal:
   - Web portal (browser-based)
   - Mobile client (APK) as a future deployment target
5. Establish a secure channel to you (the Founder & Constitutional Steward)
   using Identity Guard for verification.

This repo defines **who PrimeForge is and how it must behave**.
Implementation details (backend, UI, APK build) are up to your chosen stack.
